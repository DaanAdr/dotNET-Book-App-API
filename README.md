# Program architecture
When starting this project, the application followed a repository pattern for its architecture. I have since come to view the pattern as superfluous for most applications. And have instead begun to become more a fan of keeping things simple. As such I've resorted to putting most, if not all, of my logic into the controller in an effort to keep the application easily readable.
